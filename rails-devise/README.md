# RottenPotatoes with Associations

_This is a preliminar implementation of the RottenPotatoes Rails' App based the repositories of [Engineering Software as a Service](https://github.com/saasbook). The original code has been revised by Prof. Giovanni Farina_

Follow the commands reported in [commands.txt](commands.txt) to set up the environment.

In this assignment, you'll experiment with [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) to allow users to sign in using local credentials. Devise sets up the environment for you and makes standard routes available to users to log-in/out, register, change password, etc.
Devise is highly configurable and tailorable to the specific needs of your application. 

The steps to follow for this assignment are described in the corresponding slides available on Classroom.
