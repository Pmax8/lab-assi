# Hello Rails!

**Contents take and adapted from the SaaS book course material.**
*Thanks also to Giovanni Farina for shortening the docs.*

In this assignment you will create your first Rails app from scratch:
a simple app called RottenPotatoes (inspired by the real web site
RottenTomatoes) for cataloging movies.

RottenPotatoes lets users interactively (via a Web browser) create
database entries for new movies, view or modify the content of movie
records (movie title, rating, description, and so on), and delete
movie records.  

In later assignments, you'll add features to the app, such as the
ability to filter the list of movies or associate reviews with movies.

## Learning Goals

After this assignment, you should know how to:

1. Create a new Rails app from scratch 

2. Set up a database to store the Rails models, by writing and
executing an initial migration describing the database's schema

3. Create a basic set of controller actions and views to
support the CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) on a resource
in a Rails app, and specify HTTP routes that map to the controller actions

## Lab Parts

1. [Part 1: Set up to create a new app](Part1.md)

2. [Part 2: Create the database and initial migration](Part2.md)

3. [Part 3: Create CRUD routes, actions, and views for Movies](Part3.md)
